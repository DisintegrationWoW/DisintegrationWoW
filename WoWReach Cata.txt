We are actually preparing the best core available on the market. Why? Because we created a partnership with 3 awesome friendly no-competitive servers (AT, Paragon, Frostmourne). We associate our skills for the best. We will be ready to open a PTR (Public Test Realm) in a few weeks.

The final server as no official ETA yet. Unoficialy, around May 2013.
